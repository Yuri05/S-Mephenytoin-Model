The presented PBPK model of S-mephenytoin has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with S-mephenytoin as a substrate of CYP2C19.

Mephenytoin is a hydantoin-derivative anticonvulsant used to control various partial seizures and was first used in the 1940s ([Troupin 1979](#5-References)).

Only limited clinical PK and ADME data are available. Mephenytoin is soluble and rapidly absorbed with a Tmax of 1 hour. The mean half-life in human is 6.8 hours. No hints for dose non-linearity could be found in literature.

Mephenytoin is the mixture of the two enantiomers S- and R-Mephenytoin. S-Mephenytoin is mainly metabolised via CYP2C19. Only a very minor part is metabolised by CYP2C9. The R-enantiomer is not metabolised by CYP2C19. The clearance of S-Mephenytoin in CYP2C19 EM is 40 to 100-fold higher than in PM.
